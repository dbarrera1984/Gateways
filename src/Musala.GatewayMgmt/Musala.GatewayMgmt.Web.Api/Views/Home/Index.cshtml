    <h1>GATEWAYS</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        This sample project is managing gateways - master devices that control multiple peripheral devices.
        This is a REST service (JSON/HTTP) for storing information about these gateways and their associated devices.
        This information must be stored in the database. When storing a gateway, any field marked as "to be validated"
        must be validated and an error returned if it is invalid. Also, no more that 10 peripheral devices are allowed for a gateway.
        The service must also offer an operation for displaying information about all stored gateways (and their devices) and
        an operation for displaying details for a single gateway. Finally, it must be possible to add and remove a device from a gateway.
